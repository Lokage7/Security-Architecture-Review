**Date:** 11-30-2025

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a mock Security Architecture Review (SAR) for an AWS-hosted web application. The lab practices GRC Engineering concepts including risk identification, quantification, continuous monitoring, and automated remediation.

## Contents
- **SAR.md** – Full Security Architecture Review report with findings, recommendations, and remediation plan.  
- **risk_register.csv** – Sample risk register with quantified risks and GRC engineering-focused recommendations.  
- **ARCHITECTURE.png** – High-level architecture diagram showing system components, trust boundaries, and data flows.  
- **LICENSE** – Repository license (MIT recommended).

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk areas in AWS-hosted web application (S3, IAM, CloudTrail).  
- Apply technical GRC controls and automation to mitigate risks.  
- Quantify risks to prioritize remediation efforts.  
- Demonstrate SAR documentation and structured risk management.
