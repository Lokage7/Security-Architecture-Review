# Security Architecture Review (SAR) Project

**Author:** Sharaden Cole  
**Date:** 2025-11-30  

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a mock Security Architecture Review (SAR) for an AWS-hosted web application. The goal of this lab is to practice GRC Engineering concepts including risk identification, quantification, and automated monitoring.

## Contents
- **SAR.md** – Full Security Architecture Review report with findings, recommendations, and remediation plan.
- **risk_register_example.csv** – Sample risk register used to track and quantify risks.
- **ARCHITECTURE.png** – High-level architecture diagram of the system.
- **LICENSE** – Repository license (MIT recommended).

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk areas in a cloud environment (S3, IAM, CloudTrail).  
- Apply GRC Engineering best practices: automation, continuous monitoring, and enforceable policies.  
- Quantify risk for prioritization and actionable remediation.  
- Demonstrate SAR documentation and structured risk management.
